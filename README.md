# Electric-Fields

This is a program to visualize the electric field emmited by charged particles. They move according to the Coulomb's law. 
The electric field can be displayed at each point (blue arrow field) or with field lines, that are tangent to the electric field. 
There's still a lot to do: display electric equipotentials, potential and kinetic energy estimation as well as being able to
connect multiple dots together to make "magnetic" structures.
